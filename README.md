## Overview

### Description

Kettk is an event platform where users can discover and create events based in Kazakhstan's two largest cities: Almaty and Astana.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** Experience includes geolocation, push notifications, and real-time updates
- **Story:** People are always looking for events to attend and there's no such an app in Almaty or Kazakhstan. These are only published on Instagram or websites and are inconvenient to use.
- **Market:** Youth (16-25 years old) in Almaty and Astana.
- **Habit:** Twice a week. They consume the content but verified accounts can also regularly create content to publish events.
- **Scope:** The app is challenging but interesting to build.
